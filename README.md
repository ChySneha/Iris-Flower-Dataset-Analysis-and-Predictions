# Iris Flower Dataset Analysis and Prediction

A comprehensive Python project using the Iris dataset to analyze flower characteristics, explore data patterns, handle outliers, and build predictive models.


🔍 **Features**

### 📥 Data Loading and Cleaning
- Load and inspect the classic `IRIS.csv` dataset.
- Handle missing values and ensure data integrity.

### 🧠 Feature Engineering
- Convert species names to categorical values.
- Extract and transform features for better performance and visualization.

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics of all features.
- Countplots, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps.
- Detect patterns and anomalies in the data.

### 🚫 Outlier Detection & Transformation
- Identify and handle outliers using Z-score method.
- Apply log transformation to normalize skewed features.

### 📈 Model Building & Prediction
- Train a logistic regression model to predict Iris species.
- Evaluate model performance with accuracy and confusion matrix.
